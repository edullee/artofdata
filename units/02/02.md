## Different Types of Data [(slides)][types]
Data is organized into different categories, which inform which techniques should be used to analyze that data.

ðŸž› You should be familiar with the following terms:
> qualitative, quantitative  
> categorical: nominal, ordinal  
> numerical: discrete, continuous


## Data Structures
As we've seen before, data can be stored in lists and dictionaries. We will learn some _abstract_ structures used to organize data. These structures can be _implemented_ using lists and dictionaries.

### Stacks [(slides)][stacks]
A stack is a linear data structure that is **Last In, First Out**.

ðŸž› You should be familiar with the following terms:
> push, pop, top

### Queues [(slides)][queues]
A queue is a linear data structure that is **First In, First Out**.

ðŸž› You should be familiar with the following terms:
> enqueue, dequeue, front, back

### Trees [(slides)][trees]
A tree is hierarchical data structure.

ðŸž› You should be familiar with the following terms:
> parent, child, node, leaf, root, branch
