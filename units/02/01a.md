# Research Discussion
## Objectives
  - To get a sense of what different studies are out there
  - To see what classmates are interested in
  - To practice critically analyzing datasets from the real world

## Small Group Discussion (30 minutes)
Break into groups of 3-4.
Each person in the group spends ~5 minutes talking about the study they wrote about. Make sure to address the following points:
  1. Background info about the study
  2. The researchers (people, institutions, etc) & the data
  3. Your blog post response

After each person has shared, discuss as a group:
  1. Which study was the most believable?
  2. Which study was the least believable?
  3. What questions do you have about the research(ers)?
  4. Were there any studies that presented something surprising?
  5. Have you learned anything new about conducting research?

## Class Discussion (15 minutes)
