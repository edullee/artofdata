## Visualizing Different Types of Data
We'll mainly follow [Claus O. Wilke's text](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/visualizing-amounts.html) to learn about how different types of data can be visualized, along with corresponding supplemental material.

## Supplemental Material
There are _tons_ of resources out there! Here are some to browse through:
▲: [Visualization Analysis and Design by Tamara Munzner](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/)  
▲: [Data Visualization: A practical introduction by Kieran Healy](http://socviz.co/index.html)  
▲: [Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi)
