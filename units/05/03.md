So far we've been using `seaborn` to visualize our datasets, but what if we want more customization?

## Altair
> Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on Vega and Vega-Lite.

More information and documentation can be found [here](https://altair-viz.github.io/). `Altair` uses the language of marks and channels, which we've been practicing for the past unit.
