So far we've been analyzing our datasets through description and summarization. However, it can also be very useful to use existing data to *predict* some information about the future. This idea of **inferential statistics** depends heavily on an understanding of probability.

## Intro to Probability
Let's start thinking about probability by looking at some classic examples, such as rolling dice and flipping coins.

> ⊕ random, sample space, event  
> ⊕ experimental vs theoretical probability  
> ⊕ law of large numbers

## Working with Probabilities
Once we've established how to work with probabilities of single events, how can we start looking at combinations of events?

> ⊕ contingency tables  
> ⊕ intersection, union of events  
> ⊕ conditional probability, independence  
> ⊕ writing code for probability simulations
