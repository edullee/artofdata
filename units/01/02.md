These topics are foundational to everything else we will be doing in this course.

## Terminal [(slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BPYoFd7H3KoPspI3g46gtgqptdY8SAHnpiMBcv91Ye4/)
Terminal is a text-based interface that allows you to interact with your computer.

You should be familiar with **file directory structures** and the following terms:
> root directory, parent/child relationship, file vs folder

You should be comfortable with the following commands:

> man, pwd, ls, cd, cat, mkdir, touch, cp, mv, rm, rmdir, echo, sh

We will be using Git to keep your portfolio website updated, as well as keep track of your homework and labs.

Markdown is the markup language you will be using to make your portfolio website. I will go over this in class, but feel free to get a head start by reading through some of the following resources:
