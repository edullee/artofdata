We've been talking about random outcomes and finding the probabilities of certain events happening. To formalize these concepts, we can use the vocabulary of **random variables**.

## Random Variables
A **random variable** is a numerical variable whose value depends on the result of a random phenomenon. What other properties do they have, and how do we work with them?
