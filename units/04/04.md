## Objectives

This lab is intended to **evaluate** your ability to:

- use `pandas` to analyze and explore a dataset
- use `Altair` to create visualizations for a dataset
- explain your design choices for your visualizations

This lab is intended to **review**:

- preparing a dataset for analysis
- statistically describing variables of a dataset using supporting evidence
  - e.g. summary statistics, distributions, conditional proportions

## End Goal

Our final project is going to be creating a blog post in the style of the following examples. This lab is intended to be a stepping stone to help you get there. As you work through this project, consider what skills you would need to develop more to acheive this end goal. Make your own decisions about what to prioritize during this *much* shorter-term project. You will write a reflection on these decisions.

## Task

You can use one of the datasets on Google Classroom, or find one on your own that you are interested in. Submit a Python notebook or a blog post as described below:

1. Statistically describe your dataset. This should include at least one **exploratory visualization**. Your analysis should include not just the numbers, but also your interpretation of what those numbers mean. This section should include responses to the following questions:
   1. What is being recorded? What might be left out?
   2. What are you hoping to learn from this dataset?

2. Choose one key takeaway from your analysis to create at least one **explanatory visualization**. This visualization should be clearly labeled and be accompanied with a narrative. This narrative should give readers a clear sense of context and expand upon what your visualization shows.
   1. Why did you choose to visualize this (as opposed to something else)?
   2. What are your marks and channels? How did you make these decisions?

3. (_Reflection_): Reflect on your process with the end goal in mind. e.g. What did you prioritize? What did you have fun doing? What did you spend the most time on? What went well, and what do you want to go better next time? What else can I do to help prepare you for the longer term project? This reflection should be at least a paragraph.

Your submission should be in the style of the attached examples. Given the time constraints, you **do not** have to be as polished or in-depth, but your submission should still be something you'd be proud of sharing. Proofread and polish!

## Academic Honesty

You _are_ allowed to work with others on this lab, as long as you **do not** share any code or files! Please refer to [the syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/syllabus#academic-honesty) for more details.

You _are_ allowed to use modules we haven't talked about in class, as long as they are **cited**, and in your blog post you include an explanation of how and why they are used.
