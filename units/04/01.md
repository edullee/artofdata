We've spent a lot of time now on how data can be obtained and stored, as well as how to evaluate the quality of a dataset. Once we are confident in a dataset, we can start using statistics to describe it.

## Introduction [(slides)][intro]
We will discuss the first step of descriptive statistics: obtaining frequencies. We will learn some vocabulary on how to visualize and discuss data distributions. 

> 🞛 summary statistics  
> 🞛 limitations (sample vs population)  
> 🞛 frequency, distribution  
> 🞛 categorical bar chart (Pareto)  
> 🞛 histogram, mode, uni/bimodal, shape, skew, symmetric, tail  

## Measuring Center and Variability [(slides)][center]
Once we have a good sense of a dataset's distributions, we can start to go more in detail with our descriptions. Two properties we often look at in statistics are center and variability.

> 🞛 mean, median, mode  
> 🞛 normal distribution, bell curve  
> 🞛 standard deviation
