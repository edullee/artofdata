So far we've learned how to describe *one* variable at a time. Of course, we can compare these descriptions against each other, but we will learn some formalized methods to directly describe these relationships.

## Bivariate Analysis
How do we find and interpret the relationship between two variables? What information can we gain, and what information *can't* we gain?

> ⊕ side-by-side charts  
> ⊕ association  
> ⊕ contingency tables, basic probability, conditional proportions  
> ⊕ scatterplot, Anscombe's Quartet  
> ▲: chi-square, goodness-of-fit, independence testing  

## Linear Regression
Once we have an understanding of how two variables are related, how do we use this information to make educated predictions?

> ⊕ correlation  
> ⊕ regression line, line equation  
> ⊕ residuals, least squares
