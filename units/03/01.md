We've spent some time now programming and working with data structures. Let's start our delve into statistics!

## The Sample Frame [(slides)][frame]
What are some important things to keep in mind as we design statistical studies? We will discuss sample frames, as well as issues that may arise.

â–² [Tyler Vigen: Spurious Correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)

> ðŸž› observational samples, correlation vs causation  
> ðŸž› sample frame  
> ðŸž› coverage bias  
> ðŸž› probability vs nonprobability sampling  
> ðŸž› selection bias

## Sampling Methodology [(slides)][method]
Once we have chosen our sample frame, how do we actually obtain samples?

> ðŸž› quota, convenience, voluntary  
> ðŸž› simple random, interval, stratified, cluster  
> ðŸž› non-response and response bias

## Practice
choose one of the following questions & go through the steps
identify population
identify feasible sampling frame
choose method of sampling & describe how and why this method chosen
what errors might come up, and how are you going to deal with them?

### Objectives
  - Learn how to pose questions and identify populations
