# Assignments
I generally _do not_ assign hard deadlines for homework. These assignments are meant for you to learn and practice. However, it is encouraged that you work according to [the schedule]({{site.baseurl}}/schedule/), so that you can follow along in class. If I notice that you are not keeping up with the homework, I will reach out, followed by a potential discussion with your grade dean.

# Discussions
Readings will be given to supplement the course material. Each reading will include a written response, as well as participation in an in-class discussion. These will be graded on a similar 0-4 scale, details of which will be provided for each discussion.

# Assessments
Quizzes will only ever cover what you have done for homework, and what we have done together in class. They will be given in the middle of each unit.

Labs assess whether you can take everything you've learned so far and put it together, often in the format of a longer programming assignment and a corresponding write-up. Labs will be given at the end of each unit. Details will be provided when these assessments are given.

All assessments will be assigned **letter grades**.

There are no corrections, except for extenuating circumstances discussed between us and your grade dean.

# Academic Honesty
Any submitted work by a student should be their own, unless students are collaborating on a group assignment, in which case the work submitted should be a reflection of equal effort of all students involved. Collaboration is encouraged. Feel free to talk with other students! However, during these discussions, _do not write down_ any solutions. Students must always note whom they worked with. Failure to do so will result in an integrity penalty.

Any form of cheating will result in a **failing grade** and the student’s advisor will be notified for the first offense. Any subsequent offense will result in the student being asked to speak with their class dean. Forms of cheating include but are not limited to: similar / identical code submitted, solutions submitted that are not a student’s own work.
