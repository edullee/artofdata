# Description
**Art of Data** prepares students to approach, investigate, and present their findings of data, with the understanding that it is not enough to look only at the numbers. This course teaches students how to interpret the many statistics and graphs they encounter in their everyday lives. Students learn not only how to _answer_ questions with data, but also how to _ask_ good questions. Readings about both historic and current events are assigned to explore the social impact of data, and students are tasked with thinking about strategies to tackle the many inequities that data science perpetuates. Assignments for this course include writing programs to analyze data, creating data visualizations, and writing blog posts to communicate findings. Students finish this course with a comprehensive portfolio of resources and projects.
