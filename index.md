# Description
_Art of Data_ will prepare students to approach, investigate, and present their findings of data, with the understanding that it is not enough to look only at the numbers. It is crucial that students also gain an appreciation for the intricacies of the domains that datasets come from. Students will be tasked with thinking about the social impact of data, as well as strategies on how to tackle the inequities that arise in this field.
